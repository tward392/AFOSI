Sir,

To remedy the Liaison paragraph issue we would like to do the following:

Activate A2.2.33 as  "Liaison Functions"

Switch "Operations Security (OPSEC) - Sensitive Purchases" from its current value - A2.2.35,  to A2.2.34 as indicated below.

Please let us know that these paragraph changes are correct.

Thanks,
Wayne

Sir,

In change request #3902, did it leave the reference to A2.2.33 as just Liaison Function?  Please let me know.  Thank you.

Sir,

This was deactivated per change request #3902.

From the CR:

" The newest regulation on E-Funds does not separate Liaison's into Formal or Informal sections. The paragraph for section of the E-Funds expense pages still shows Para. A2.2.33 and A2.2.34 for informal and formal functions, however Para. A2.2.34 now covers OPSEC-Sensitive Purchases. Also, the current amount for receipt needed is $100.00; the current Receipts Disposition drop-down menu still shows $75.00."

Thanks,
Wayne

Have received two calls and had them submit trouble tickets through the help desk but the paragraph for liaison event seems to not be in web cfms/efms
